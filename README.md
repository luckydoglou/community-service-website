Description from product owner:
    The non-profit organization aims at benefiting a small community by providing
    various kinds of services to the local community. The non-profit will charge small
    fees for some services to cover its costs. Other services will be offered free of
    charge. Additionally, the non-profit organization will rely on volunteers to provide
    some of the services offered to the community. It will also rely on a number of paid
    employees (full time and part time employees) to take care of managing the
    business and running the services, as well as the operational costs and other
    activities. The main sources of income for running the business will be donations
    from known and anonymous donors as well as from small fees charged for some
    of the offered services. The organization will run from a local building, which offers
    large spaces for organizing social events like weddings, community meetings, and
    funerals. It will also offer rental service for equipment needed for the events, as
    well as catering services. Other in-house services include Spanish, arts and crafts,
    and painting classes given by volunteers. External services are also offered in
    terms of home care for the elderly and handicapped as well as shuttle services.
